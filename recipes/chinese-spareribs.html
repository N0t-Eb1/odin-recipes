            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These Chinese spareribs are tender, juicy, and delicious. I created this recipe after nothing caught my eye while searching for a good sparerib recipe. I cook the spareribs in a broiler tray in the oven, but they should be fine to cook on a grill.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sake (or Chinese rice wine)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>
                <li>1 pound pork spareribs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

                <li>Mix hoisin sauce, ketchup, honey, soy sauce, sake, rice vinegar, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, and five-spice powder together in a shallow glass dish. Place ribs in the dish and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a broiler tray with enough water to cover the bottom. Place the grate or a rack over the tray; arrange ribs on the grate.</li>

                <li>Cook in the preheated oven on the center rack for 40 minutes, turning and brushing with marinade every 10 minutes.</li>

                <li>Let marinade cook on for final 10 minutes to make a glaze. Finish under the broiler if desired. Discard any remaining marinade.</li>
